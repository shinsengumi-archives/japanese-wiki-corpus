<h1>Muryoju-kyo Ubadaisha Ganshogechu (the Commentary on Verses on the Aspiration to Be Born in the Pure Land) (無量寿経優婆提舎願生偈註)</h1>
<p>Muryoju-kyo Ubadaisha Ganshogechu (the Commentary on Verses on the Aspiration to Be Born in the Pure Land) was compiled by Tanluan, a Buddhist monk in the Northern Wei dynasty (China). It was an commentary given to "Muryoju-kyo Ubadaisha Ganshoge (the Verses on the Aspiration to Be Born in the Pure Land)", also known as Jodoron (the Treatise on the Pure Land Sutra), which was compiled by Seshin (Vasubandhu). In general, it is called "Ojoronchu" (the Commentary on the Treatise on Rebirth in the Pure Land) or "Jodoronchu" (the Commentary on Treatise on the Pure Land). It is also called "Ronchu" for short. It comes in two volumes of the first and the second. 
<br/>(Taisho Shinshu Daizokyo Sutra, vol. 40, p. 826)<br/>
</p>
<p>The "Jodoron" is a commentary on the "Muryoju-kyo Bussetu Muryoju-kyo" (the Sutra on the Buddha of immeasurable life), which means that this book is an additional commentary on it. </p>
<p>It clarifies that the cause and effect of death of all living things are caused by the Original Vow of Tathagata (Buddha), that is, Other Power, and later formed the basis of the Pure Land sect. </p>
