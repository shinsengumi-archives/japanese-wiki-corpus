<h1>"Makyo" (An Unbalanced Mental Condition That An Ascetic Of Zen Sect Of Buddhism Can Fall Into During Meditation) (魔境)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Makyo" refers to an unbalanced mental condition of ego-swelling that results from excessive self-consciousness, into which an ascetic of the Zen Sect of Buddhism tends to fall when halfway awakened. Some people <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> out that this mental condition is what they call 'spiritual inflation' in Jungian psychology. </p>
<p>Nichiren taught his followers that they should pierce the illusional images of Buddhas or Tathagatas with an imaginary spear when these images appear in their meditation. When an ascetic has a sense of unity with a man of divinity in his meditation, he tends to be obsessed with the idea that he himself is great, and this swells his ego -- in other words, he falls into makyo -- and the above-mentioned teaching of Nichiren is said to have aimed to prevent his followers from falling into makyo. </p>
