<h1>The Ogura family (小倉家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Ogura family were kuge (court nobles) with kakaku (family status) of urinke (the fourth highest family status for court nobles). They came under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. 
<br/>They were a branch family of the Toin family of the Saionji family group<br/>
Their family business was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> (sacred music and dancing performed at shrines). Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamon (family).html">kamon</a> (family crest) was migi mitsudomoe (clockwise three comma-shaped figures in a circle). Karoku (hereditary stipend) during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> was 150 koku (approx. 27.1cubic meters). After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, they held the title viscount. </p>
<p>The family was founded during the Kamakura Period by Kino OGURA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Vice-councilor of state), who was the second son of Jitsuo YAMASHINA. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> on July 8, 1884, the peerage of viscount was conferred on Hidesue OGURA. </p>
