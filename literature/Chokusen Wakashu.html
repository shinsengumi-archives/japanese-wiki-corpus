<h1>Chokusen Wakashu (勅撰和歌集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "chokusen wakashu" represents an anthology of Japanese poetry complied under order of an emperor or a retired emperor. Starting with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) (completed in 905) until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinshoku (Shinto Priest).html">Shinshoku</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (New Continued Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) (completed in 1439), 21 chokusen wakashu were compiled during the 534 years. These 21 anthologies are commonly known together as 'Nijuichidai-shu' (The Twenty-One Collections of Japanese Poetry). There is also a quasi-Imperial anthology called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shinyo Wakashu (Collection of New Pages).html">Shinyo Wakashu</a> (Collection of New Pages), which was compiled by the Southern Court. Imperial anthologies are classified into three groups according to the year of compilation: Sandai-shu (Three Major Collections of Japanese Poetry) (containing the Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry, the Later Collection of Japanese Poetry, and the Collection of Gleanings), Hachidai-shu (Eight Major Collections of Japanese Poetry) (see below), and Jusandai-shu (Thirteen Major Collections of Japanese Poetry) (see below). 
<br/>(Note that the Sandai-shu anthologies are also included in the Hachidai-shu)<br/>
