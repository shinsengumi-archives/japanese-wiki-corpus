<h1>Moshinsho (孟津抄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Moshinsho is a commentary on "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>," written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tanemichi KUJO.html">Tanemichi KUJO</a>, the Kanpaku (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) during the Sengoku (Period of Warring States) and Azuchi-Momoyama periods. Although the original consisted of 20 volumes, there are surviving texts with 15 volumes, 21 volumes and 54 volumes. 
<br/>It later came to be called "Kuzensho," after another name of his, 'Kujo Zengo.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He was taught by his uncle, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kineda SANJONISHI.html">Kineda SANJONISHI</a>. He added to the Genji scholarship of the Sanjonishi family not only theories on earlier commentaries such as the "Kakai-sho," the "Kacho yojo" (Atmosphere of Flowers and Birds) and the "Rokasho" (playing with blossoms), but also theories of his own, and annotated each volume. Although some draft-manuscripts and fair copies exist, it is believed that few original manuscripts and prints have survived. </p>
