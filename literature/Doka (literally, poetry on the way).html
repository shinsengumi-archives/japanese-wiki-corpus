<h1>Doka (literally, poetry on the way) (道歌)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In contrast to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poetry as art, doka refers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> (31 syllables' poem) or waka (Japanese poem) that includes Buddhist teachings or that Zen monks composed to make study and spiritual enlightenment easier to understand. </p>
<p>The following poems are given as examples. </p>

<p>When you make koicha (thick tea), be sure to use fairly hot water, dry the tea bowl before starting to make it, and stir the tea powder well into a paste; but it shouldn't be stirred so that the tea has bubbles or lumps.' (Doka by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>)<br/>
