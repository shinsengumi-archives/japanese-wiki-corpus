<h1>The Tale of Shinobine (しのびね)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Tale of Shinobine refers to a courtly romance which was completed at the end of the Heian period and was subsequently lost, or to an adaptation of a story produced during the period of Southern and Northern Courts (Japan). It is a typical tragic love story where the hero becomes a monk and the heroine either dies or makes her way into the court. The title, 'Shinobine,' represents the heroin 'silently weeping' from her painful love. </p>
