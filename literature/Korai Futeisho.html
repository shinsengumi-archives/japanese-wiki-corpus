<h1>Korai Futeisho (古来風体抄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Korai Futeisho is a textbook on poetry that was completed during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. There is an initial edition (completed in 1197) and a revised edition (completed in 1201). </p>
<p>The initial edition is said to have been written by the courtier and poet, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Toshinari.html">FUJIWARA no Toshinari</a> (1114 - 1204) at the request of Imperial Princess Shikishi (1149 - 1201) who was a princess of Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>. It is believed that the revised edition was also written upon the request of Imperial Princess Shikishi. Between the initial and revised editions, there is another edition that seems to have been a modification of the initial edition. </p>
<p>The book has a selection of 191 poems from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), and 395 poems (398 poems in the revised edition) from Imperial waka poem anthologies up to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senzai Wakashu.html">Senzai Wakashu</a> (Collection of Japanese Poems of a Thousand Years), with a history of waka poems. The textbook teaches that waka poems reveal the true characteristics of the target of the poem. </p>
