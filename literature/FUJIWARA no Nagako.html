<h1>FUJIWARA no Nagako (藤原長子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Nagako (c. 1079 - year of death not known) was a female waka poet in the late Heian period. Her father was Sanuki no Nyodo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Akitsuna.html">FUJIWARA no Akitsuna</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Iemichi.html">FUJIWARA no Iemichi</a> (Kunaikyo [Minister of the Sovereign's Household]) was her elder brother. Her name as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> (court lady) was Sanuki no suke. </p>
<p>Because her elder sister Kaneko was the wet nurse of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a>, she started to serve for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a> in 1100 and was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> (a court lady of the first rank) in 1101. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a> died in July 1107, she started to serve for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> from the following year 1108 by the command of the Cloistered Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>. From the autumn of 1118, however, she often prophesied something on the pretext of being possessed by the spirit of former Emperor, including the prophet concerning <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a>'s pregnancy and delivery. 
<br/>Due to the above, she was regarded in the following year as a lunatic and placed in the custody of her elder brother FUJIWARA no Michitsune after being relieved of the service at court ("Choshuki" [diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Morotoki.html">MINAMOTO no Morotoki</a>], October 6, 1119)<br/>
</p>
<p>Two volumes of her diary 'Sanuki no suke Nikki,' in which she depicted the situations surrounding the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a> until his death, remain. This diary is renown in the history of literature as the one in which a close aide wrote with adoration about an Emperor's death. </p>
