<h1>Ryounshu (凌雲集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryounshu (lit. a collection from above the clouds) is the first anthology of Chinese poems compiled in Japan by the command of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> in 814 during the early Heian period. The entire anthology is one volume and its official title is Ryouunshinshu. Ryounshu was compiled by a number of people, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/ONO no Minemori.html">ONO no Minemori</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/SUGAWARA no Kiyokimi.html">SUGAWARA no Kiyokimi</a>. Within the anthology, there were 23 writers, including Emperor Heijo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> composing a total of 90 poems.
