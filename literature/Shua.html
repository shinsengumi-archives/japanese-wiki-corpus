<h1>Shua (周阿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shua (year of birth unknown - c. 1377) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet (linked-verse poet) in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) who belonged to the ordinary people class. His secular name was Saka no Kojiro. </p>
<p>He learned <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gusai (the Renga master).html">Gusai</a> (or Kyuzai) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet) and was regarded as his successor. He was involved in the compilation work of 'Oan Shinshiki,' which established the rules of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> selected by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimoto NIJO.html">Yoshimoto NIJO</a>. He once went to the eastern region of Japan in an unknown year and went to Kyushu in his last years. His intellectual and people-surprising style of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> was popular in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> society in the early Muromachi period. </p>
<p>His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> was selected for '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tsukubashu.html">Tsukubashu</a>' as well as 'Murasakino Senku' and 'Jiko Shua Hyakuban <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uta-awase.html">Uta-awase</a>' etc. </p>
