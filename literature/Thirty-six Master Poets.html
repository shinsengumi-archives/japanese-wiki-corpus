<h1>Thirty-six Master Poets (三十六歌仙)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Thirty-Six Master Poets is a collective term for the 36 master waka poets included in "the Thirty-six Master Poets Selection" as selected by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinto.html">FUJIWARA no Kinto</a>. </p>
<p>Nishi honganji bon sanjurokunin kasyu (The works of the thirty-six master poets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>) is the oldest existing copy of the summarization of poems of these 36 poets. </p>
<p>Influenced by the Thirty-six Master Poets, other master poet designations such as the Medieval 36 Master Poets and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">Nyobo</a> sanjurokkasen (Thirty-six female poets of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">Nyobo</a> sanjurokunin utaawase) were established later on. </p>
<p>Thirty-six syllable <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (the linked verse) is referred to as 'kasen' (master poet) after the Thirty-Six Master Poets. </p>
