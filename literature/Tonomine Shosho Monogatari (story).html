<h1>Tonomine Shosho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (story) (多武峯少将物語)</h1>
<p>Tonomine Shosho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (The Tale of the Lesser Captain of Tonomine) is a story. It has one volume. It is also called Takamitsu Nikki (The Takamitsu Journal). The author is unknown. It was probably written in the period between the Owa era and the Koho era. This story covers the days and life of Takamitsu FUJIWARA until he moved to Tonomine and entered into priesthood in August 961, mainly through Japanese poems exchanged between Takamitsu and his wife and sister. </p>
