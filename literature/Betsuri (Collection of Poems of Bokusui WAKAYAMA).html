<h1>Betsuri (Collection of Poems of Bokusui WAKAYAMA) (別離 (若山牧水の歌集))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Betsuri is a collection of poems written by Bokusui WAKAYAMA. It was published in April 1910. Betsuri is comprised of two volumes: the first collection entitled 'Umi no Koe' and the second collection entitled 'Hitori Utaeru' collectively consisting of 1004 poems including some new works. There were many lyric poems singing the praise of joys and sorrows of youth in Betsuri that made Bokusui a prominent naturalistic poet who ultimately came to acquire a status in the circle of poets. </p>
