<p>"Haru no Hi" (Spring Days) is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> collection. It was edited by Kakei YAMAMOTO. The collection was published in 1686. It is one of the Haikai Shichibushu (seven <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> collections by the Basho School). It is the sequel to "Fuyu no Hi" (Winter Days), and people living in Owari Province were participants. It has kasen (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> sequences of 36 verses) and 58 hokku (first lines of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> sequences) composed in places such as Jugo ga iori (Jugo's hermitage) and Yasui-tei (Yasui's bower). The 'Furu ike ya' (Old pond) poem by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a> and two other verses by him are included among them. </p>
