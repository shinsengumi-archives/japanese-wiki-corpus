<h1>Fuji no uraba (Wisteria Leaves) (藤裏葉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fuji no uraba is one of the 54 chapters of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." It is the 33rd chapter. The title of this chapter was derived from the waka poem that To no Chujo (the first secretary's captain) composed: "New leaves of wisteria in the sunlight of spring; if you open your heart to me, I will place my trust in you." </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, age 39. </p>
<p>In April, the Minister of the Palace held a flower festival at his residence, and approved a marriage between his daughter, Kumoi no Kari, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, who had been in love with each other for a long time. Both <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> and the Minister of the Palace were pleased with the happy newlyweds. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, it was decided that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>'s daughter, young lady <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>, would enter the Imperial Court. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a> gave up the role of guardian to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Lady Akashi.html">Lady Akashi</a>, the birth mother. </p>
<p>The two mothers first met when their daughter entered the Imperial Court as a bride, and they changed positions with each other. They saw each other's virtues and approved of each other, so there was no ill feeling and they reached an understanding. </p>
<p>In autumn, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, approaching his 40th birthday celebration, came to be treated as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jun Daijo tenno.html">Jun Daijo tenno</a> (quasi ex-emperor) and the Minister of the Palace got promoted to Daijo daijin (Grand minister of state). In November, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> went to the Rokujo-in Palace together, where a splendid banquet was held. </p>
<p>And thus, the prophecy that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> was told by someone from Goryeo when he was a boy came true, and he was in the height of his prosperity. </p>
