<h1>Kyoto Prefectural Insho-Domoto Museum of Fine Arts (京都府立堂本印象美術館)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kyoto Prefectural Insho-Domoto Museum of Fine Arts is an art museum in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>In 1966, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Insho DOMOTO.html">Insho DOMOTO</a>, a Nihonga (Japanese-style painting) painter, founded the museum to exhibit his works, and he also designed its unconventional exterior. It is located in front of the main gate of the Ritsumeikan University Kinugasa Campus on Kinukake-no-michi Road, an area blessed with a rich environment of nature and famous temples. </p>
<p>The museum and its collections were presented to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> in 1991 and were then opened as the Kyoto Prefectural Insho-domoto Museum of Fine Arts. In accordance with the Designated Manager System, the Ritsumeikan Academy has been designated to perform the administrative operation of this museum since June 2006. </p>
