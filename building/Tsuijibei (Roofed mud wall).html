<h1>Tsuijibei (Roofed mud wall) (築地塀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A tsuijibei is a wall made of rammed earth. 
<br/>It is also simply called 'tsuiji.'<br/>
Most of them are made by a method called 'hanchiku' in which columns are built on a stone wall foundation and a frame with rails is built and then encased in a wooden frame and mud is poured in and rammed with a stick. A simple roof truss is built on top of the wall and this is usually covered with tiles or planks. Many such mud walls were built around aristocratic residences, temples or government quarters from olden days and even now they can be seen around the Imperial Palace and temples. Large scale Tsuijibei are called 'ogaki' and the one on the south side of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara) reached 12 meters in height. </p>
