<h1>Ganri-mon Gate (含利門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ganri-mon Gate was one of the 19 gates of the Buraku-in (Reception Compound) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daidairi.html">Daidairi</a> (Greater Imperial Palace). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is a hisashimon (gate with a canopy) located in the north gallery of Enei-do Hall. Some illustrations depict the north gallery of Enei-do Hall as a tsuiji (a mud wall covered with a roof) but these are simplified illustrations that were created later. There was originally north gallery which was connected to the south gallery of Kantoku-do Hall, and Ganri-mon Gate located in between these. There are also illustrations in which the gate on the north gallery is depicted as Kaimei-mon Gate but these are also incorrect. </p>
