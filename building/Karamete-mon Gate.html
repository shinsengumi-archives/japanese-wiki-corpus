<h1>Karamete-mon Gate (搦手門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Karamete-mon Gate is one of the castle gates located at the karameteguchi (back gateway), as opposed to Ote-mon Gate (main gate) being at the front of the castle. </p>
<p>In times of emergency, the Karamete-mon Gate allowed people, including the feudal lord, to escape from a castle or escape to outside the walls surrounding a castle. </p>
<p>The Karamete-mon Gate building itself was often inconspicuous, being small and narrow and in some instances, the Karamete-mon Gate was built according to the specification of a compact Kabuki-mon gate and not a Yagura-mon gate, but it was very securely designed to be adequately guarded by a small number of people, in contrast to a large <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Koguchi (a castle entrance).html">koguchi</a> (castle entrance), such as the Ote-mon Gate. The bridge at this gate was often made of wood. </p>
