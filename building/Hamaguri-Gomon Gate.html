<h1>Hamaguri-Gomon Gate (蛤御門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Hamaguri-Gomon Gate is one of the west gates of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Gyoen National Garden.html">Kyoto Gyoen National Garden</a>. The official name of the gate originally was the Shinzaike-Gomon Gate. The gate is a sujigane-mon (iron girder gate) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Korai-mon Gate.html">Korai-mon Gate</a> style. </p>
<p>The gate came to be called by its nickname Hamaguri-Gomon Gate because it was the gate that rarely opened, but it opened like a hamaguri (clam) when the imperial palace burned in the Great Kyoto Fire of the Tenmei period during the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kokaku.html">Emperor Kokaku</a>. It's name ended up being official. The gate was the defense base for the Aizu, Kuwana, and Satsuma allied clans during the Conspiracy of Hamaguri-Gomon Gate, and the gate still has bullet holes made at the time. </p>
