<h1>Menreiki (面霊気)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Menreiki is one of Japanese specters that is introduced in "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (One hundred bags in idleness) which is a collection of specters illustrations by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>, and it is a specter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gigaku-men Mask.html">Gigaku-men Mask</a> (masks for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gigaku (Japanese silent dancedrama in which performers wear masks).html">Gigaku</a>, an ancient masked drama). </p>
<p>It says in the explanatory note as follows. 
<br/>'In the era of Prince Shotoku, Kawakatsu HADA made many masks.'<br/>
As if in a dream, I think it may have been Kawakatsu's contrivance that made the masks have life.'<br/>
According to the book on noh theory, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fushikaden (Flowering spirit).html">Fushikaden</a>" (The Flowering Spirit) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a>, Kawakatsu SO who was the originator of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a> (form of theatre popular in Japan during the 11th to 14th centuries) who served Prince Shotoku was given a mask that the prince himself had made, and Menreiki is said to have been depicted based on this anecdote. </p>
<p>It is a Tsukumo-gami (gods to a variety of things) that have come to life when an prominent mask became old, and there is a theory that it pleads the owner to handle with care. </p>
