<h1>Konacha (Dust Green Tea) (粉茶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konacha is the powdery fragments collected in the production process of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sencha (green tea).html">sencha</a> (green tea of middle grade). </p>
<p>Being, as it were, remnants of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sencha (green tea).html">sencha</a>, konacha is cheap, but is often said to be of good taste for its price as the quality itself of tea leaves is as good as that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sencha (green tea).html">sencha</a>. </p>
<p>As konacha is powdery, this tea can easily dissolve in water, and a strong tea of a vivid green color can be brewed. </p>
<p>Konacha is the standard tea served in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> restaurants. </p>
