<h1>Genroku no Daikoshu (元禄の大古酒)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Genroku no Daikoshu is sake which is believed to be prepared in the Genroku era and took off a seal in Mochizuki-machi, Kitasaku County, Nagano Prefecture in 1968. </p>
<p>It was brewed around 1689 and its Nihonshu moromi-zukuri was stored including solid contents without filtration. So, the aging period is 279 years. </p>
<p>When it was opened, the contents decreased by evaporation and the alcohol degree rose to 24%. It is much higher than that of normal sake. It is assumed that it was because the difference of molecular size between water and ethyl alcohol made the difference of penetrating power. </p>
<p>The color of sake turned black. </p>
<p>The container was a white porcelain pot and the cap was lacquered paulownia sealed by giving a final coat of lacquer. The pot is owned by Osawa Shuzo Shiryokan now. </p>
