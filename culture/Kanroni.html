<h1>Kanroni (甘露煮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanroni is one of boiled and seasoned dishes. It is also called ameni (literally, candy cooking). </p>
<p>After broiling mainly freshwater fish such as ayu (sweetfish), carps, gobies, crucian carps, and lake smelts without seasoning or as raw, simmer them in the soup with soy sauce, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a> (sweet cooking rice wine), and plenty of sugar and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mizuame.html">mizuame</a> (starch syrup) to have 'teri' (glaze). </p>
<p>Simmer them slowly for a long time until the bones become soft and add <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mizuame.html">mizuame</a> last to have teri again. </p>
<p>It turns out just right with small fish than big one. </p>
<p>It is also called kanroni that fruits like chestnuts and Chinese oranges are boiled with sugar. </p>
