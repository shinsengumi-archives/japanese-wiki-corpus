<h1>Kakoishio (囲塩)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kakoishio is specially purified traditional salt for preservation, and also called furuzumijio (traditional Japanese purified salt for preservation). </p>
<p>Salt is kept in an underground facility with roof covering, to avoid water percolation, for over a summer to a year. This process drains out water and bittern and makes kakoishio, which do not lose in weight. This is a precious source of salt in a snowy area in the winter and mountain-ringed region. </p>
