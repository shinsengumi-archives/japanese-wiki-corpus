<h1>Toso (the mixture of sawdust of paulownia wood and wheat starch) (桐塑)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toso is a kind of clay. </p>
<p>Toso is the clay made by mixing sawdust of paulownia with shofu-nori (wheat starch paste) and is sometimes blended with washi (Japanese paper) in order to provide strength. </p>
<p>Immediately after mixing, it is soft, but it increases in strength when dried. </p>
<p>As it has better detail reproducibility than soil clay and its surface can be carved like wood, it is used for mass production of wood carving. </p>
