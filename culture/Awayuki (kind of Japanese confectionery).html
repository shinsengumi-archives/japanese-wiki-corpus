<h1>Awayuki (kind of Japanese confectionery) (淡雪)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A kind of Japanese confectionery, awayuki, or awayuki-kan, is likened to light snow and it has a texture like snow melting in the mouth. There are some variations in Chinese characters for awayuki and awayuki-kan, such as "淡雪," "泡雪," "阿わ雪," "淡雪羹" and "淡雪かん." </p>
<p>It is the confectionery made by melting Japan agar after adding water, and then boiling it down with sugar, and molding it after mixing with meringue (confectionery). When mixing with meringue, it is better to cool the agar to body temperature to avoid separation caused by hot temperature. By using gelatin instead of Japan agar, it becomes marshmallow. </p>
<p>Awayuki is famous as souvenir sweets in the cities like Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture (Bizenya), Miyoshi City, Hiroshima Prefecture, and Shimonoseki City, Yamaguchi Prefecture. </p>
