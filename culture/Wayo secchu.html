<h1>Wayo secchu (和洋折衷)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wayo secchu' refers to the way in which Japanese style and Western style are blended together. </p>
<p>In cooking, it means to adopt the characteristics of both Japanese cooking and Western cooking in a dish; typical examples include '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Anpan.html">anpan</a>,' which is a type of sweet bread (Western) with azuki bean jam (Japanese), and a dish of Carpaccio using tuna fish. It also refers to the way food is served such as when Western dishes and Japanese dishes are both served together. </p>
<p>There is also a term 'wakanyo,' meaning the blend of Japanese, Chinese and Western styles. Further, 'wakon kansai' means to learn from China academically without losing the Japanese identity. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Wakon yosai (Japanese spirit with Western learning).html">Wakon yosai</a>' is a term coined during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period to mean the same as above, but learning from the West instead. </p>
