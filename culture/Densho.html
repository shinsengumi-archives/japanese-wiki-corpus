<h1>Densho (伝書)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Densho (books on the esoterica - also written as 傳書) is a manuscript or book of secret techniques of schools of Japanese art and martial arts. </p>
<p>It could be called a type of textbook or a manual nowadays, but was not written for beginners or for general public. It is a manuscript that included the structure of that school, oral lesson, methods, or secret techniques that granted to an heir or the one who received <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokuroku.html">mokuroku</a> (a certificate of the completion of the art) or a permit from the master. There is also the Shito-ryu school of Karate School that renew densho and pass it down. </p>
