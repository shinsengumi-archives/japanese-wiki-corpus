<h1>KANZE Sakon (観世左近)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakon KANZE is a name which has been handed down from generation to generation by the headmen of the shite-kata (actors who play leading characters in Noh performances) Kanze school. From the 7th generation headman Mototada through the 25th generation headman Motomasa, 11 headmen used this name. </p>
<p>The 24th generation headman <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoshige KANZE.html">Motoshige KANZE</a> is particularly famous among them; he was popular because of his good looks and beautiful voice, which brought overwhelming popularity to the Kanze school during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>, the Taisho, and the Showa periods. </p>
