<h1>Junka (a diving method) (順下)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Junka is a diving method of Japanese martial arts swimming. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
A diver takes off with one leg from a height and opens both legs like a running stride at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of diving. Immediately after hitting the water, he strongly closes both legs and pushes the water down with both hands, to avoid the head sinking under water. </p>
<p>This is said to be a measure to be able to gaze steadily at the enemy even when a person dives wearing Kacchu (armor and helmet). </p>
<p>It is also said to be the specialty of Mukai school. </p>
<p>It is also adopted in Ota group of the Suifu school (a style developed for swimming and combat in fast steams). </p>
<p>It is called 'jingasa tobi' (literally, "soldier cap jumping") in Kankai school. It is reportedly named as this method is used when wearing jingasa (a soldier's cap). </p>
