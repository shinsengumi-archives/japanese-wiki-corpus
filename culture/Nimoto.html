<h1>Nimoto (煮もと)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Ni-moto" was one of the producing methods of "Nanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Moro-haku.html">moro-haku</a>," the sake (Japanese rice wine) that had a reputation of having the highest quality and grade from the mid-Heian period to the end of the Muromachi period. </p>
<p>In modern terms, ni-moto can be described as a high-temperature saccharification method, which falls under "ki-moto" (one of the methods for preparing the starter mash). </p>
<p>By simmering the moto (the starter mash) in a pot, its volume increased, and undoubtedly simmering must have been performed within a very narrow temperature range because the yeast would have been killed if the temperature was too high. </p>
<p>Since there were no thermometers at that time, it is obvious that the temperature adjustment fully depended on the brewer's sense, and this suggests the method was a highly skilled technique which demanded a lot of experience. </p>
