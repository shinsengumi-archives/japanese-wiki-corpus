<h1>Mata-nozoki (bending down and looking at scenery from between one's legs) (股のぞき)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mata-nozoki is one of the methods to enjoy looking at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Amanohashidate.html">Amanohashidate</a> from Kasamatsu Park or Ama no Hashidate View Land in Miyazu city, in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>The method</h3>
</p>
<p>People get on a platform for Mata-nozoki at the observatories in the places above, turn their back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Amanohashidate.html">Amanohashidate</a>, and bend down and look from between their legs. The scenery seen following the method above is called "a bridge built over the heaven" or "a dragon going up to heaven." </p>
