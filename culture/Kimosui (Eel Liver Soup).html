<h1>Kimosui (Eel Liver Soup) (肝吸い)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kimosui is a clear soup containing the guts of eel as a main ingredient. The "kimo" in kimosui means literally liver, but actually it's a region of the guts generally composed of the stomach and other parts of adhesive organs, such as the kidneys and bowels. Kimosui is usually a clear soup "sumashi-jiru", without miso (soybean paste) or other murky sauces but with such ingredients as fu (bread-like pieces of wheat gluten). These guts are considered to be suited for clear soup, since they contain less fat than the part used for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabayaki.html">kabayaki</a> (broiled eel). </p>
