<h1>Zokuso (the modern music of koto [a long Japanese zither with 13 strings]) (俗箏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zokuso (zokugoto) is the koto or the koto music from the time Yatsuhashi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> reformed the koto music in the early modern ages of Japan, and his koto contrasts with gakuso (the koto used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> [ancient Japanese court music and dance]). The 'Tsukushi goto' and 'Tsukushi school of koto music,' which were both started by Priest Kenjun and the direct origin of Yatsuhashi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>'s koto and koto music, are not included in zokuso. </p>
<p>For the instruments and the details of zokuso, please refer to the articles on So and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a>. </p>
