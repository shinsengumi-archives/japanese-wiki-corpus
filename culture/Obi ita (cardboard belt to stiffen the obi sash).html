<h1>Obi ita (cardboard belt to stiffen the obi sash) (帯板)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>An obi ita is an accessory used to set the shape of obi (sash). Another name : maeita. </p>
<p>It is a plate-like accessory that is made by putting cloth on the cardboard-made padding, and people use it by inserting it in the front face of obi. </p>
<p>As it is a tool to arrange the shape of obi, it is devised to keep the shape of obi even when obi is fastened in a complicated manner. </p>
<p>The size of products varies widely from the one for girls whose size is similar to adults' palm to the one that can press the entire front of obi. </p>
<p>Nowadays people can show their obiita with lace plastered from the rim of obi, and obiita is becoming a kind of accessory rather than an aid tool for wearing kimono. </p>
