<h1>Miyasundokoro (御息所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Miyasundokoro or Miyasudokoro<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a>'s rest area<br/>
</p>
<p>A lady serving at the Imperial Court who was lower rank than the Emperess<br/>
A generic name of serving ladies at the Imperial Court who were favourites with the Emperor, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (a high-ranking lady in the court who was a consort of the emperor), koi (a lady in waiting in the court) and other lower rank ladies<br/>
</p>
<p>Imperial Princess<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Miyasundokoro was…</h3>
</p>
<p>Miyasundokoro literally meant the Emperor's rest area. Then gradually, it came to mean a lady serving at the Imperial Court who served at the Emperor's bedroom. In one theory, it means <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> or koi who was a mother of Prince and Princess, but it is generally accepted that it was the name of ladies at the inner palace who were loved by the Emperor, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> and koi except for serving ladies. It sometimes meant <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (female palace attendants), and there was a precedent that the Emperor's mother was called Grand Miyasundokoro. Later, the meaning of Miyasundokoro which was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> and koi faded out, and then Miyasundokoro became the name for crown princess and Imperial Princess. </p>
