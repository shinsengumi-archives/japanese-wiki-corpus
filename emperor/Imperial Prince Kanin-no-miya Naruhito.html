<h1>Imperial Prince Kanin-no-miya Naruhito (閑院宮愛仁親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Kanin-no-miya Naruhito (February 17, 1818 – October 20, 1842) was a member of the Imperial family who lived in the Edo period. He was the fifth family head of the Kanin-no-miya family. His father was Imperial Prince Kanin-no-miya Tatsuhito. In 1828, he was given the title of Imperial Prince and celebrated his coming of age. As Imperial Prince Naruhito had no heirs, Imperial Prince Kanin-no-miya Kotohito, the 16th son of Imperial Prince Fushimi-no-miya Kuniie, succeeded to the family in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. After the death of Imperial Prince Naruhito, the wife of Imperial Prince Tatsuhito was treated as the family head. </p>
