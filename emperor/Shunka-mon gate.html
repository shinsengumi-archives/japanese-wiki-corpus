<h1>Shunka-mon gate (春華門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shunka-mon gate is one of the outside gates in the Imperial Palace. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The Shunka-mon gate was located at the end of the south east side of the outer wall of the Imperial Palace and paired up with shumei-mon gate across from Kenrei-mon gate. </p>
<p>Since there were Samaryo (Left Division of Bureau of Horses) on the east and west side, this gate is also called 'Sama no jin.'<br/>
When court nobles who were granted Teguruma no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">senji</a> (special permission given to specific people in Imperial family, consort and ministers from the Emperor to enter the imperial palace in a handcart where an ox-drawn carriage was banned) arrived at Imperial Palace, it was a practice to get off their cart at the Shunka-mon gate. </p>
