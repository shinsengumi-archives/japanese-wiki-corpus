He was born in Ishikawa County, Kawachi Province (Osaka Prefecture). He was a son of TAKENOUCHI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>, and the father of Soga no machi. Also there is a theory that judging from the name, this figure was an imaginary person created by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGANOKURA-YAMADA no Ishikawamaro.html">SOGANOKURA-YAMADA no Ishikawamaro</a> or some of his descendents. </p>
