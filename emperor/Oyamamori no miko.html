<h1>Oyamamori no miko (大山守皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oyamamori no miko (earlier than 257 - March 31, 310) was the first prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>. His mother was Takakinoirihime. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a> passed away, he plotted to succeed the Imperial Throne, and with hundreds of soldiers, he raised an army against Iratsuko UJINOWAKI and Osasagi no miko (the later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nintoku.html">Emperor Nintoku</a>) who were strong candidates for the succession, but when he was crossing the Yodo-gawa River on a ship, he drowned because Iratsuko UJINOWAKI who heard the story from Osasagi no miko that suspected Oyamamori no miko's plan, disguised himself as a ferryman and purposely capsized the ship. </p>
