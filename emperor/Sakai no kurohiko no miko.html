<h1>Sakai no kurohiko no miko (境黒彦皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakai no kurohiko no miko (earlier than 401 - 456) was the second prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ingyo.html">Emperor Ingyo</a>. He was described as '坂合黒彦皇子' Prince Sakai no Kurohiko in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters). </p>
<p>When his younger brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>, was murdered by his own stepchild, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mayowa.html">Prince Mayowa</a>, Sakai no kurohiko no miko was almost murdered in conspiracy of his younger brother Ohatsuseno wakatakeruno miko (the later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>) who was trying to succeed the Imperial Throne. For this reason, Sakai no kurohiko no miko and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mayowa.html">Prince Mayowa</a> consulted together and escaped to the residence of Katsuragi no tsubura no omi, but despite the minister's plea to spare their lives, Prince Ohatsuse burned all three of them together. </p>
<p>Also, another description tells that they were killed in the residence of Katsuragi no tsubura no omi by Prince Ohatsuse. </p>
