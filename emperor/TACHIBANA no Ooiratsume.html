<h1>TACHIBANA no Ooiratsume (橘大郎女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TACHIBANA no Ooiratsume (year of birth and death unknown) was a wife of the Prince Shotoku. She was a daughter of Owari no Oji, a son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a> and her grandmother was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a>. TACHIBANA no Ooiratsume and the Prince Shotoku had two children, Shirakabe no Miko (the Prince Shirakabe) and Teshima no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> (the Princess Teshima). </p>
<p><h3>Tenjukoku Mandara Shucho</h3>
</p>
<p>When the Prince Shotoku died in 622, with the permission of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a>, TACHIBANA no Ooiratsume ordered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Uneme.html">Uneme</a> (the ancient court hostess) to make the Tenjukoku Mandara Shucho (tapestries with embroideries representing Tenjuku paradise, also called Tenjukoku Shucho). It is believed that mourning his death, TACHIBANA no Ooiratsume wished to picture the Tenjukoku paradise where the Prince Shotoku was believed to have been after his death. It is the oldest existing embroidery and designated as a National Treasure. The Tenjukoku Mandara Shucho had been preserved in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chugu-ji Temple.html">Chugu-ji Temple</a>, but there are only fragments of the embroidery remaining today, with most of them being lost. </p>
