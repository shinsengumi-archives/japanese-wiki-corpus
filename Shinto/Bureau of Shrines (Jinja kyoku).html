<h1>Bureau of Shrines (Jinja <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>) (神社局)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Bureau of Shrines was one of the bureaus of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government. </p>
<p>The bureau was established in the prewar Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan). It took charge of administrative matters relating to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priesthood. </p>
<p>On April 26, 1900, after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Bureau of Shrines and Temples.html">Bureau of Shrines and Temples</a>, the Ministry of Home Affairs was discontinued, the work was divided into the Bureau of Shrines and the Bureau of Religions. In other words, the Ministry of Home Affairs was reorganized to establish seven bureaus in the ministry, add Bureau of Shrines to Bureau of Areas, and rename <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Bureau of Shrines and Temples.html">Bureau of Shrines and Temples</a> as Bureau of Religions. </p>
<p>The bureau's staff included one director, one secretary, one investigator, two engineers, one clerk and two assistant investigators. </p>
<p>On November 9, 1940, the bureau was discontinued upon the establishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Jingiin (Institute of Divinities).html">Jingiin</a> (Institute of Divinities). </p>
