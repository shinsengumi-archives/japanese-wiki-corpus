<h1>Jingiin (Institute of Divinities) (神祇院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Jingiin was an organ of the national government of Japan. It was an external bureau of the Home Ministry. It no longer exists. </p>
<p>Under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (Agency of the Department of Divinities) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> refomation campaign, the Insitute of Divinities was founded in 1940 as part of the ceremonies commemorating the 2600th year of the founding of Japan. Having produced no particularly noteworthy results, with the promulgation of the Shinto Directive after the war, on February 2, 1946, it was abolished. </p>
