<h1>Tahirikishimarumi no kami (多比理岐志麻流美神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tahirikishimarumi no kami was a god (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion) who appeared in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. </p>
<p>He was appeared as the fifth grandchild god in the genealogy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> no kami in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), but nothing but the god's name was stated, so the name was also unknown. In fact, it was stated that he was a child god born between the forth grandchild god of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> no kami, Mikanushihiko no kami and Hinarashibime who was the daughter of Takaokami no Kami by marriage. </p>
