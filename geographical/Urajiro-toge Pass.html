<h1>Urajiro-toge Pass (裏白峠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Urajiro-toge Pass is a pass located between Koga City in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> and Ujitawara Town in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is an old road of Route 307 and it required early improvement since it was a traffic choke <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> which had continuous steep slopes and sharp curves. However, the traffic bottleneck was relieved after the opening of new bypass which was approximately 2km including Chaya Tunnel (390m in length). </p>
