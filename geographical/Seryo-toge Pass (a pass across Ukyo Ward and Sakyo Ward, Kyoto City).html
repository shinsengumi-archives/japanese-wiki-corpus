<p></p>
<p>Seryo-toge is a pass across <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> of the same city. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The pass is located on Kyoto Prefectural Road 361 Kamikuroda Kibune Line at an altitude of 680 meters, separating Keihoku-seryo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and Kurama-kibune-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> of the same city. Close to the pass, the Haiya-gawa River runs on the side of Seryo, where Seri (dropworts) were growing wild. A lore says the above is the origin of the name. It used to be the most popular route to go to the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> from the Keihoku-Shuzan district. Kibune, famous for its Kawayuka (Riverside Summer Terrace), located at the foot on the side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, started as something like a chaya (a rest house) where people who came over the Seryo-toge Pass took a break and got fixed. This pass is considered to be deeply involved in the history of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. <h3>Features of the pass</h3>
</p>
<p>The pass is travelable for vehicles. Although, it is a slap with series of steep hills and sharp curves that well maintained sections with double lane and narrow sections at 1.0-lane wide, where a vehicle cannot pass an oncoming car, continue intermittently. Particularly on the side of Kibune, there is a spot where the hill is as steep as 20 degrees or more with successive sharp hairpin curves, where a large-sized vehicle cannot make a turn at the first try. At the bottom of the hill, however, lies an area developed as a touristic district with fancy Japanese-style restaurants and kawayuka Terraces, where the traffic increases. Kibune, in particular, is famous as a summer resort and the traffic sometimes gets jammed in summer. The pass has a totally different sceneries on its north and south sides. <h3>Facilities around the pass</h3>
