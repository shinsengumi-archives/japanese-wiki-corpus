<h1>UMEDO Katsunoshin (梅戸勝之進)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Katsunoshin UMEDO (date of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Shinsengumi. His birthplace is unknown. </p>
<p>He joined the Shinsengumi in around 1866. He was given the status, Mimawarigumi and Oyatoi, in June, 1867. During <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenmanya Incident.html">Tenmanya Incident</a>, he helped <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hajime SAITO.html">Hajime SAITO</a> who had a hard fight and was seriously injured. He escaped death and served in the Shinsengumi as hatayaku (flag man) in the Battle of Toba and Fushimi. It is said that he still had the fresh scar from a sword wound on his face. After the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma, he went to Aizu with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hajime SAITO.html">Hajime SAITO</a> to serve as a role of Kagoyaku (the role of palanquin). Then he surrendered to the enemy in Sendai on September 12. </p>
<p>After that, he was never heard from again. It is considered that he had already died before the erection of the memorial monument of the Shinsengumi in 1876. </p>
