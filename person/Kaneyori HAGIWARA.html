His real father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaneharu YOSHIDA.html">Kaneharu YOSHIDA</a>. His mother was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>.

He was the ancestor of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hagiwara family.html">Hagiwara family</a>. </p>
<p>After he was deliberately adopted by his grandfather <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanemi YOSHIDA.html">Kanemi YOSHIDA</a> in 1599 according to Kanemi's plan, he held the position of clerical worker at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Toyokuni-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Toyokuni-jinja Shrine</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> was enshrined, and came to use the family name Hagiwara.
