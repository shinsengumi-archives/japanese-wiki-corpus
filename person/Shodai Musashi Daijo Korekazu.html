<h1>Shodai Musashi Daijo Korekazu (初代武蔵大掾是一)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The first Musashi Daijo (the third rank official of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>) Korekazu (Korekazu ISHIDO) was a sword craftsman in the Edo period. </p>
<p>By the classification of Japanese sword, his works are classified into the excellent quality, and generally called 'Kawakami Sakon.'<br/>
Korekazu was originally from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and moved to Edo to make swords. His sword's hamon (the figures appeared on the surfaces of a sword) was Choji (nuts of cloves) of Ichimonji style (a style originated from a sword craftsman Ichimonji). On shinogi (the streaks of each side of a sword) of his swords, sharp masame (straight grain) can be seen, unlike Ko-Ichimonji style (older Ichimonji style). </p>
