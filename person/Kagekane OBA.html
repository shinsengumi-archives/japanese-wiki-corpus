<h1>OBA Kagekane (大庭景兼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kagekane OBA was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warrior in the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was of a branch line of the Kanmu-Heishi (TAIRA clan). He was the legitimate son of Kageyoshi OBA. </p>
<p>He was also known as Oba Kojiro Kagekane. </p>
<p>After Kageyoshi OBA, who played an important role in the early days of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period as an elder, went into priesthood, Kagekane took over as the head of the family. </p>
<p>It is estimated that he disappeared or fell from power during the Battle of Wada in 1213, one of the greatest events in the history of purging of powerful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>. </p>
<p>His whereabouts are unknown after 1213. </p>
<p>Kagetsura OBA, who was assigned to jito (manager and lord of manor) of Bingo Province in the same year, is assumed to be either a brother, son, or a close blood relative of Kagekane. </p>
