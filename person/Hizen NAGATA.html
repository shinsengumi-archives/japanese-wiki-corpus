<h1>NAGATA Hizen (長田肥前)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hizen NAGATA (year of birth and death unknown) is a figure from the Azuchi-Momoyama period who appears in such written accounts as the Hokimindanki (History of Hoki Province) and the Inabashi (History of Inaba Province). He was a jizamurai (rural <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) who lived in the village of Hasshoji in Keta county, Inaba province (modern-day Tottori Prefecture). </p>
<p><h3>His career</h3>
</p>
<p>Almost all details of his life and career remain unknown, including even the year in which he was born and that in which he died, but what is known is that he was a jizamurai who lived in Hasshoji village in Keta county (Tottori Prefecture today). In the Inabashi his name is written with a different character for "naga", though the pronunciation is the same. He took part in the Thirteen Days' Collapse in Nagota, which occurred in the ninth month of 1580; he led a group of more than 30 relatives, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kohichiro FUKUI.html">Kohichiro FUKUI</a>, into the mountains of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Narutaki (Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Narutaki</a> village and the area near Hasshoji village and killed Ujitomi YAMANA and his vassal <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genzo SHINOMIYA.html">Genzo SHINOMIYA</a>, who were on the side of the losing Nanjo clan. But even before this incident, the Kikkawa clan had issued notification to villages in that area for all defeated warriors to be rounded up, so in history books Nagata is described as having acted as he did out of hunger for rewards. </p>
