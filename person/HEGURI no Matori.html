<h1>HEGURI no Matori (平群真鳥)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>HEGURI no Matori (year of birth unknown) was a minister in the reigns of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seinei.html">Emperor Seinei</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kenzo.html">Emperor Kenzo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninken.html">Emperor Ninken</a>. His father was Hegurino-kiu. Hegurino-shibi was his son. </p>
<p>He became a minister during the era of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a> and brought the height of prosperity of the Hegri clan. </p>
<p>After the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninken.html">Emperor Ninken</a>, he attempted to assume the position himself, however <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Kanamura.html">OTOMO no Kanamura</a> opposed Matori's intention and defeated him under the order of Ohatuse no wakasagi no mikoto (later day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Buretsu (Muretsu).html">Emperor Buretsu</a>); as a result, Matori killed himself and part of the Hegri clan head family went downfallen (there is also a rumor of survival). </p>
<p>He is believed to have made Takeuchi-monjo (an ancient text which recorded the lineage of ancient kami and a dynasty preceding Emperor Jinmu) under the order of Ohatuse no wakasagi no mikoto. </p>
