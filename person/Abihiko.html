<h1>Abihiko (安日彦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Abihiko is a legendary person in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Chusei Nihongi (A set of medieval Japanese myths).html">Chusei Nihongi</a> (A set of medieval Japanese mythologies). Abihiko is also known as Abio. </p>
<p>In "Soga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (the tale of Soga), which was established during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> through Muromachi periods, Abihiko is described as Demon King Abi who was exiled from the ancestral Ezo (northerners). Abihiko is supposed to be the older brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Nagasunehiko.html">Nagasunehiko</a>, and some say that Abihiko and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Nagasunehiko.html">Nagasunehiko</a> made an escape to Hirosaki in Aomori Prefecture, and others say that Abihiko was singly exiled to the Tsugaru region. </p>
<p>However, neither "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters) nor "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) does not mention about Abihiko. Abihiko is generally regarded as a fictious person, but a theory says that Abihiko is actually the same person as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Nagasunehiko.html">Nagasunehiko</a>. </p>
