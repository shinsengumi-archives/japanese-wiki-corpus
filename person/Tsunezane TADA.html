<h1>TADA Tsunezane (多田経実)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunezane TADA (date of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the originator of the Tada clan of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. It is believed that he was from Tada clan, which was the direct descendant of the Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan), and was the eighth generation of the decendent of MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka (TADA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Manju (Bun stuffed with filling).html">Manju</a>) and the son of MINAMOTO no Takayori (the name of Tsunezane is not confirmed in the family trees including "Sonpi Bunmyaku" [a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy]). However he is also said to come from Nakamura clan of Hirose County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, and his pedigree record is uncertain. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/The Tada clan.html">The Tada clan</a> lost the Tada-no-sho estate, which was their territory for generations; therefore Tsunezane TADA moved from his birthplace Settsu to Tada, Uda-gun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (Tada, Murou-ku, Uda City, Nara Prefecture) in the Kempo era (1213 to 1218) and settled there. Afterwards, descendents of Tsunezane continued as powerful local lords (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a>) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> inland of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> through out the medieval period. </p>
