<h1>"OE no Koremitsu" (大江維光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OE no Koremitsu (1110 - February 17, 1175) was a court noble in the Heian period. He was the grandson of OE no Masafusa who reached the court title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), and the son of OE no Korenobu (also called OE no Masatoki) who assumed Higo no kuni no kami (the governor of Higo Province). Koremitsu himself reached Jusii (Junior Fourth Rank) and the official of Shikibusho (Ministry of Ceremonial). </p>
<p>When he was monjosho (a student of literary studies in the Imperial University), he passed Horyakushi (the exam for selecting Court officials), and then he held various positions, such as Shikibu shoyu (Junior Assistant of the Ministry of Ceremonial) and Shikibu no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Ceremonial). He had a reputation as an expert on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kidendo.html">Kidendo</a> (the study of the histories). </p>
