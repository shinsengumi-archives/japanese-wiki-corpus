<h1>NANJO Tokimitsu (南条時光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokimitsu NANJO (1259 - May 25, 1332) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who lived in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a firm believer of NIchiren. He was the jito (lord of manor) of Ueno-go, Suruga Province (the present north-western (Ueno) part of Fujinomiya City, Shizuoka Prefecture). He was called 'Ueno-dono' (Lord of Ueno). </p>
<p>Succeeding to his late father, Hyoe Shichiro, at the age of seven, he became a believer in Hokkekyo (the Lotus Sutra) as his father was. He had since then periodically sent offerings to Nichiren who lived in Mt. Minobu. </p>
<p>At the Atsuhara Persecution of Nichiren in 1278, he followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> who resisted the religious persecution by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, making great efforts to protect and support the believers. 
<br/>Nichiren praised him for his profound faith and gave him the honorific title of 'The Wise Lord of Ueno.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After Nichiren died, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> subsequently left Mt. Minobu in disagreement with Sanenaga HAKII. Tokimitsu immediately received <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> in his territory and became a founding patron of Honmon-ji Temple to which he gave the land in 1290. </p>
<p>In 1323 he converted his house in Shimojo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Horinouchi.html">Horinouchi</a> into Shimojo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoren-ji Temple.html">Myoren-ji Temple</a> for his deceased wife, Myoren. </p>
<p>In 1332 he died at the age of 74. </p>
<p>His posthumous Buddhist name (homyo or kaimyo) was Daigyosonrei. </p>
