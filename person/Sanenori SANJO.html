<h1>SANJO Sanenori (三条実教)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanenori SANJO (year of birth unknown - October 1, 1641) was a kuge (court noble) who lived during the era from the end of Muromachi period to the Edo period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kine OGIMACHISANJO.html">Kine OGIMACHISANJO</a>. Kinhisa HANAZONO was his son. His government rank was Sakone no chujo (middle captain of the left division of inner palace guards) and held the rank of Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade). He was the founder of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a> family. </p>
<p>He was born in the Ogimachisanjo family, a branch of the Sanjo family. He was adopted by the Sanjo family, but none of his descendents became the head of the Sanjo family, though the reason is not known. Because his governmental rank was rather low, it is surmised that he died young. The name Sanjo was inherited by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetsuna SANJO.html">Sanetsuna SANJO</a> who was adopted from the Sanjo-nishi family, another branch of the Sanjo family. The descendents of Sanenori formed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a> family, a branch of the Ogimachisanjo family. </p>
