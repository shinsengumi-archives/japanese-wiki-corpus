<h1>SUMINOKURA Soan (角倉素庵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Soan SUMINOKURA (June 27, 1571-August 7, 1632) was a civil engineering worker, calligrapher, and trading merchant in the early Edo period. 
<br/>He was a noshoka (a calligraphy luminary) and one of 'the three greatest calligraphy luminaries in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>.'<br/>
He was the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoi SUMINOKURA.html">Ryoi SUMINOKURA</a>. His by-name was Yoichi, and his real names were Kuroyuki, Sadatoshi, and Mitsumasa. </p>
<p>He learned Confucianism from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Seika FUJIWARA.html">Seika FUJIWARA</a> and calligraphy from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Koetsu HONAMI.html">Koetsu HONAMI</a> and founded the Suminokura school of calligraphy. Following in his father's footsteps, he also engaged in a trading business and civil engineering works.
