<h1>MUNAKATA no Tokuzen (宗形徳善)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MUNAKATA no Tokuzen was a local ruling family in the Munakata region, Fukuoka Prefecture. Munakata (宗形) can also be written as '宗像,' '胸形,' '胸方,' or '胸肩' in Chinese characters. He was the father of Amakonoiratsume, a consort of Emperor Tenmu. He is believed to be a descendant of Atakatasumikoto. </p>
<p>Some historical material say that his father was Takamaru and the others says he was Motomaro, but in any case, there is no credibility. </p>
<p>His offspring succeeded to a priest of the Munakata-taisha Shrine. It is said that, in the era of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, the post of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest was handed over to Imperial Prince Koen, a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> and then the Imperial Prince changed his name to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/MUNAKATA no Kiyouji.html">MUNAKATA no Kiyouji</a> to serve as Daiguji (the supreme priest). 
<br/>(It is also said that the Imperial Prince Koen is a fictitious person created to revere Kiyouji, the first Daiguji of the Munakata-taisha Shrine.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Some says that the first Daiguji was Dairyo (Chief district official) of Munakata, but it has no credibility. </p>
