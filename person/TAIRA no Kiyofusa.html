<p>TAIRA no Kiyofusa (year of birth unknown - March 27, 1184) was the eighth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>. </p>
<p>He was appointed Awaji no kami (the governor of Awaji Province) in the Coup of the Third Year of Jisho in 1179. </p>
<p>In the Battle of Ichi no tani in 1184, he joined his brother Tomomori's troops to guard the camp at Ikuta Woods.
