<h1>ABE no Muneaki (安倍宗明)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ABE no Muneaki (year of birth and death unknown) was a yin-yang diviner during the late Heian period. He was a great-great-grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a>. His father was Tenmon Hakase (Doctor of Astronomy) ABE no Chikamune. Tenmon Hakase and Zusho no kami (Chief of the Bureau of Drawings and Books) ABE no Hirokata was his son. As a Tenmon Hakase, when earthquakes or unusual changes in celestial bodies occurred, Muneaki repeatedly provided Tenmonso (divination of natural disasters) to the Court. </p>
