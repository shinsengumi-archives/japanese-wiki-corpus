He was the third (or fourth) family head of the Kasai clan. It is said that he was Kiyochika KASAI's own younger brother, but became his adopted son. </p>
<p>As Kasai clan's family head, he was a person whose actions were not so clear. However, mainly from the material between Bunryaku era and Hoji era, it is evident that he was a powerful family head who accompanied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsune</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (Barbarian Subduing General). Succeeding to Tokikiyo was his younger brother, Kiyotsune KASAI. </p>
<p>It happened so often that a brother was recorded as a son or vice versa depending on genealogy. There are various theories about Kasai clan's detailed genealogy. </p>
