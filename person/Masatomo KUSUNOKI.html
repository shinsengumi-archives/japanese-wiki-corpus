<h1>KUSUNOKI Masatomo (楠木正具)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masatomo KUSUNOKI (1516 - 1576) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period. He was a son of Masatada KUSUNOKI.. </p>

<p>He fought hard against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> who was making attempts to invade Ise Province. However later his lord Tomonori concluded peace with Nobunaga as the odds were against Tomonori. </p>
<p>Masatomo escaped Ise and went to Kennyo HONGANJI (priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>) for refuge, and again challenged Nobunaga for a battle.
