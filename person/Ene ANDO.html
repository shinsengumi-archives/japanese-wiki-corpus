<h1>ANDO Ene (安東円恵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ene ANDO (1285-1343) was a warlord from the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the Northern and Southern Courts period, and he served in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrat) to the Tokuso Family of the Hojo clan, the family of shogunal <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). His father was Reisho ANDO, his posthumous name was Jotai and he was commonly called Jiemon. Ene was the name he used as a Zen (Buddhist) monk. There is a theory that suggests a blood relation to Seishu ANDO, who was an uncle to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a>'s wife. </p>
<p>He studied Zen from Sijian Zitan, a monk from overseas, and he became the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choraku-ji Temple (in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City).html">Choraku-ji Temple</a> in the Kozuke Province. </p>
<p>A statue of Ene ANDO now housed at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nara National Museum.html">Nara National Museum</a> is designated as an important cultural property. </p>
