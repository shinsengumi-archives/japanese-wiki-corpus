<h1>OZAKI Yahei (尾崎弥兵衛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yahei OZAKI (years of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Miburoshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group) which was the forerunner of the Shinsengumi (literally, the newly selected corps, referring to a special police force for the Tokugawa regime). </p>
<p>Yahei joined the Miburoshigumi in around June or July, 1863, as his name appeared in a 'List of Signers for Official Documents Submitted to the Shogunate' ('Bakufu Teishutsu Josho Shomeisha Ichiran' in Japanese) which was dated July 10, 1863. However, Yahei's name was not included in a 'List of Active-Duty Troops' which was created in August or September, 1863. This may be because Yahei retired somewhere before then, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinpachi NAGAKURA.html">Shinpachi NAGAKURA</a>'s "Doshi Renmei Ki" (literally, the "Record of the Fellow Troops' Names") included an alleged name of him, Yahei OZEKI, who may possibly be identical with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yashiro OZEKI.html">Yashiro OZEKI</a>. If so (i.e. if Yahei was identical with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yashiro OZEKI.html">Yashiro OZEKI</a>), he died of an illness on December 24, 1865. </p>
