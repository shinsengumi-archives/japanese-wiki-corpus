<h1>Unkoin (雲光院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Unkoin (March 16, 1555 - February 16, 1637) was a concubine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a><br/>
Her name was Suwa. Her pseudonym was Acha no tsubone, Minbukyo, Kamio Ichii and Ichii no ama (first nun). Her father was Naomasa IIDA. </p>
<p>She first married Tadashige KAMIO and had a son, and after the death of her husband, she was called by Ieyasu. She got pregnant once again but had a miscarriage, and she never had a child with Ieyasu. After the death of Saigo no tsubone, she raised <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a> and Tadayoshi MATSUDAIRA. She was very smart and served as an envoy for peace negotiations at the time of the Siege of Osaka. Since she served as Moriyaku (guardian) at the time when Kazuko TOKUGAWA entered into court, she was granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>. After the death of Hidetada, she entered into priesthood and called herself as Unkoin. Died in 1637 at the age of 83, and buried in Unkoin (Miyoshi, Koto Ward, Tokyo). </p>
