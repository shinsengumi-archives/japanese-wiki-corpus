<h1>IMAI Jikan (今井似閑)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jikan IMAI (1657 - November 1, 1723) was a scholar of the Japanese classics in the first half of the Edo period. He used the pseudonyms Kengyu and Enso-Tei. He was a wealthy merchant who went by the name of Ichibei OJIYA. </p>
<p>He studied under Sanshi KISE and Choryu SHIMOKOBE at first, and then received instruction in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves)" under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Keichu.html">Keichu</a>. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Keichu.html">Keichu</a> died, IMAI collected his favorite works and donated them to the Mite Bunko library in Kyoto Kamigamo-jinja Shrine, preserving them for future generations and preventing them from being scattered and lost. </p>
<p>His written works include 'Manyoi' (literally 'The Weave of Ten Thousand Leaves') and 'Kagurauta Chushaku' ('Notes on Kagura Songs'). </p>
