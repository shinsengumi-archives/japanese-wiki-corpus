<h1>WAKE no Hiroyo (和気広世)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>WAKE no Hiroyo (year of birth and death unknown) was an Ikan (medical officer) from the late Nara period to the early Heian period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a>. He was born in Bizen Province. </p>
<p>Hiroyo originally served in the Imperial court as a monjosho (student of literary studies in the Imperial University), but in 785 he was imprisoned for his alleged involvement in a certain incident. He was pardoned later on, and after serving as a Shohanji and Shikibu shoyu (Junior Assistant of the Ministry of Ceremonial), he was appointed as the Daigaku betto (head of the imperial university). During this time, with the cherished desire of his late father Kiyomaro, he founded the 'Kobun-in' in the private residence of the Wake clan for the children of the clan, located south of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> (Bureau of Education under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system). In 806, he took up the additional post of Sachuben (middle controller of the left). </p>
