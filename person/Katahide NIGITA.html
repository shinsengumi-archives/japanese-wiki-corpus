<p></p>
<p>Katahide NIGITA (year of birth unknown - February 4, 1348) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (a Japanese military commander) in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. He was also called Kenshu. </p>

He was the fifth (youngest) son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masasue KUSUNOKI.html">Masasue KUSUNOKI</a> and a nephew of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>. After his uncle and father died in the Battle of Minato-gawa River, he was subordinated to his cousin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatsura KUSUNOKI.html">Masatsura KUSUNOKI</a> who became the toryo (head) of the Kusunoki family, and regained their power together. </p>
<p>He was honorably brave among the Kusunoki family, and always followed Masatsura to join the battles. In 1347, he defeated the Sumida family of Kii Province, and Akiuji HOSOKAWA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiuji YAMANA.html">Tokiuji YAMANA</a> in Kawachi Province. </p>
<p>On January in 1348, he fought with Masatsura against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a> at the Battle of Shijonawate, and died in the battle. He was attacked from behind by the army of the Yuasa clan that was a former ally. He is said have been about 20 years old at that time. </p>
<p>According to an anecdote, when he was dying, he bit an enemy's neck and glared at him without releasing it, which caused the enemy to die. The locals worshiped the soul of Katahide as 'Hagami-sama' (teeth bite). </p>
