<h1>Kawakami no iratsume (河上娘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KAWAKAMI no iratsume (around 575 - around 618) was a consort of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sushun.html">Emperor Sushun</a>. She was called "KAWAKAMI no iratsume"(a girl of upriver) because she lived around the upper area of Asuka-gawa River. </p>
<p>She was a legitimate wife of Prince Shotoku; It is sometimes said that she was TOJIKO no iratsume who was the real mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Yamashiro no oe.html">Prince Yamashiro no oe</a>. However, the truth is not certain as some people say KAWAKAMI no iratsume was an elder sister of TOJIKO no iratsume. </p>
