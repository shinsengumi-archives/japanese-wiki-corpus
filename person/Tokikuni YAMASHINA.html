<h1>YAMASHINA Tokikuni (山科言国)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokikuni YAMASHINA (1452 - April 5, 1503) was a court noble in the Muromachi period. He reached the court title of Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state). His father was Yasumune YAMASHINA, and his son was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokitsuna YAMASHINA.html">Tokitsuna YAMASHINA</a>. His lawful wife was the daughter of Nagatsugu TAKAKURA. Tokikuni was born to the Yamashina branch family, but Akitoki YAMASHINA of the Yamashina head family died without his heir in 1462, so Tokiyuki became the adopted child and inherited the head family from Akitoki. Tokikuni was the writer of "Tokikuni Kyoki" (The Diary of Tokikuni). </p>
