<h1>KUTSUKI Hirotsuna (朽木紘綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hirotsuna KUTSUKI (September 1835 - September 11, 1854) was a successor of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Fukuchiyama Domain.html">Fukuchiyama Domain</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. He was the fifth son of Masanaga YONEKURA, the lord of the Mutsuura Domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>. His lawful wife was the daughter of Tsunaeda KUCHIKI. His official court rank was Kawachi no kuni no kami (governor of Kawachi Province). </p>
<p>He became the adopted son of the 12th domain lord (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Fukuchiyama Domain.html">Fukuchiyama Domain</a>), Tsunaharu KUCHIKI, and took the 10th domain lord Tsunaeda's daughter as his lawful wife.
