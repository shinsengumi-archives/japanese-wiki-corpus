<h1>John William Drake (ジョン・ウイリアム・ドレーク)</h1>
<p>However, the anger of the Japanese public could not be calmed down for the judgement, thus Foreign Minister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaoru INOUE.html">Kaoru INOUE</a> brought a charge against Drake for murder. As a result, Drake was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment from the judge Hannen of the British consulate of Yokohama. </p>
<p>John William Drake is an Englishman who lived in Japan during Meiji Period. He was the employee of the Madamson & Bell steamship company, and was the captain of the steamship Normanton. </p>
<p>On October 24, 1886, Normanton Incident occurred that all the 25 Japanese passengers on board of the ship were drowned; although Drake was accused of drowning the passengers, he was found not guilty by the British consul Troup of the consulate of Kobe, under the judgement of the consular jurisdiction. </p>
