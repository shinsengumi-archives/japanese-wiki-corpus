<h1>YAMADA Harutaka (山田春隆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Harutaka YAMADA (years of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Miburoshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group) which was the forerunner of the Shinsengumi (literally, the newly selected corps, referring to a special police force for the Tokugawa regime). </p>
<p>Harutaka joined the Miburoshigumi in around June or July, 1863. Harutaka's name appeared in a 'List of Signers for Official Documents Submitted to the Shogunate' ('Bakufu Teishutsu Josho Shomeisha Ichiran' in Japanese) which was dated July 10, 1863, but his name was not included in a 'List of Active-Duty Troops' which was created in August or September, 1863. </p>
