<h1>NAKAMURA Taro (中村太郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taro NAKAMURA (1852 - May 14, 1878) was a servant of Toshimitsu OKUBO; the First Secretary of Interior. </p>
<p>He was born in Osaka as an orphan but fostered by OKUBO and given the name Taro NAKAMURA. He served OKUBO assiduously and took a coachman's seat when traveling in a carriage and pair. On May 14, 1878, OKUBO and NAKAMURA were assassinated by six fuhei shizoku (former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> with gripes) including Ichiro SHIMADA and Go CHOREN on the way to Akasaka temporary Imperial Palace, where NAKAMURA received a fatal thrust into the throat.
