He was the family head of the Rokkaku clan in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (direct line of descent of the Sasaki clan). He was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujiyori ROKKAKU.html">Ujiyori ROKKAKU</a> (there is another view that Yoshitaka was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>). He was the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsutsuna ROKKAKU.html">Mitsutsuna ROKKAKU</a>. </p>
<p>His legitimate wife was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motouji ASHIKAGA.html">Motouji ASHIKAGA</a>.

He was trusted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> and made his son, Mitsutsuna marry a daughter of Yoshimitsu. After Yoshimitsu's death, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA</a> became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, the relationship between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and the Rokkaku clan worsened and as he did not obey an order to take the field in Hida Province, he was dismissed from the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) temporarily, but returned to his original position. </p>
