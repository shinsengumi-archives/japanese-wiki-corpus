<h1>KAZANIN Tadanaga (花山院忠長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadanaga KAZANIN (1588 - November 6, 1662) was a court noble in the early Edo period. His final court rank was Jushiinojo Sakon e no Shosho (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade, Lowest General of Sakon e Fu [Left Division of Inner Palace Guards]). He was the first son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kazanin.html">Kazanin</a> family, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morozane.html">FUJIWARA no Morozane</a> line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. </p>
<p>His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) Sadahiro KAZANIN. His mother is unknown. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadayoshi KAZANIN.html">Sadayoshi KAZANIN</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> [Junior First Rank, Minister of the Left]), who succeeded to the headship of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kazanin.html">Kazanin</a> family, was his younger brother. His sons include Sadatoshi NOMIYA (Shonii Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> [Senior Second Rank, Provisional Chief Councilor of State]), who was the first head of the Nomiya family, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kokai (Buddhist priest).html">Kokai</a> (Buddhist priest), a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tenkai.html">Tenkai</a>, who was called Kokui no Saisho (literally Chancellor in Black, a priest having a strong influence on politics). His posthumous Buddhist name was Joya. </p>
