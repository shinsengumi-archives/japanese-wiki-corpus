<h1>SAKAKIBARA Tadanaga (榊原忠長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadanaga SAKAKIBARA (1585 - March 15, 1604) was the second son of Yasumasa SAKAKIBARA, the first lord of the Tatebayashi Domain in Kozuke Province. His mother was the daughter of Yasutaka OSUGA. He was a heir apparent of the Tatebayashi Domain. </p>
<p>As his older brother, Tadamasa OSUGA, inherited the Osuga clan, his maternal grandfather's fief, Tadanaga was appointed as a heir apparent of the Sakakibara clan. Following in his father's footsteps at the Battle of Sekigahara, he participated in conflicts including the siege of Ueda-jo Castle. In 1604, however, he died at the young age of 20 without inheriting the clan from his father, who outlived him. Because Tadanaga had no children, his younger brother, Yasukatsu SAKAKIBARA, became heir apparent and took over as the head of the family when his father Yasumasa died. </p>
