<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoshiko (藤原淑子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoshiko (838 - June 22, 906) was a female noble and a court lady in the early Heian period. Her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nagara.html">FUJIWARA no Nagara</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mototsune.html">FUJIWARA no Mototsune</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Takaiko.html">FUJIWARA no Takaiko</a> were her half-brother and half-sister. </p>
<p>Yoshiko entered the Imperial Court after the death of her father, Nagara, married <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Ujimune.html">FUJIWARA no Ujimune</a>, and adopted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a>'s son, MINAMOTO no Sadami, who later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>. Yoshiko is considered to have played an important role in getting her adopted son, Sadami, back in the imperial family and ascend the throne following the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a>. In 884, she became a Naishi-no-tsukasa (female palace attendant), and in 887, she was granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank), an exceptionally high court rank for a woman. On May 28, 906, she demised at the age of sixty-nine, and was posthumously awarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) on May 30. </p>
