<h1>KONISHI Hidesada (小西秀貞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hidesada KONISHI was a child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukinaga KONISHI.html">Yukinaga KONISHI</a> and his concubine. </p>
<p>He had been entrusted to the Ukita clan since his childhood. </p>
<p>When the Ukita family was dismissed and deprived of position, privileges and properties after the Battle of Sekigahara, he escaped and came to Sanuki Province, and became the first chief priest of Sairen-ji Temple there. </p>
<p>It seems that he was not a Christian. </p>
