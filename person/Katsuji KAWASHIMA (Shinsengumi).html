<h1>Katsuji KAWASHIMA (Shinsengumi) (川島勝司 (新撰組))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Katsuji KAWASHIMA (year of birth unknown-1866) was a investigator and inspector of Shinsengumi (special police who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He was also a corporal. </p>
<p>He came from the Kawashima village in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He joined the Shinsengumi as an assistant vice commander soon after the inauguration of the special police. In the Ikedaya Incident, he joined <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>'s squad and won a reward of 17 ryos. </p>
<p>Later he was appointed as a corporal but dismissed on the ground that he was a chicken and was discharged from the special police. After that, having difficulty in making a living, he borrowed money in Osaka under the name of Shinsengumi. It is said that because of this cheating, his head was shaved in skinhead, and he was savagely murdered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yahei TOYAMA.html">Yahei TOYAMA</a> and others. His body was said to be shown in public at the bank (of the River Kamogawa) near Nijo Street. </p>
