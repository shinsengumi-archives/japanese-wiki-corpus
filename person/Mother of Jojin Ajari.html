<h1>Mother of Jojin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> (成尋阿闍梨母)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mother of Jojin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> (988 - year of her death is not clear) was a female waka poet in the mid-Heian period. She is generally regarded as a daughter of MINAMOTO no Toshitaka but according to engi (writing about history) of Kyoto Daiun-ji Temple, she is described as a daughter of Tsutsumi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>. She married <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Sanekata.html">FUJIWARA no Sanekata</a>, Mutsu no kami (the Governor of Mutsu Province), and gave birth to two children, Buddhist monk <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jojin.html">Jojin</a> and Joson. </p>
<p>She lost her husband early, in around 1014 - 1015. "Jojin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> no haha no shu" (A collection of waka poems by mother of Jojin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>), her personal anthology of waka poems, is famous as one that was composed of a mother's feelings when her son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jojin.html">Jojin</a> departed for China (Sung (dynasty)). As this anthology is something like a diary and ended in May, 1073, it is assumed that she died after that time. </p>
