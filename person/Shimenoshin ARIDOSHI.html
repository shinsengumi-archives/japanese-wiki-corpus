<h1>ARIDOSHI Shimenoshin (蟻通七五三之進)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shimenoshin ARIDOSHI (years of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Miburoshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group which was the forerunner of the Shinsengumi) and the Shinsengumi (literally, the newly selected corps, referring to a special police force for the Tokugawa regime). Due to his rare family name, Shimenoshin is often mistaken for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kango ARIDOSHI.html">Kango ARIDOSHI</a>, but the two persons are totally different. </p>
<p>Shimenoshin joined the Miburoshigumi in around June or July, 1863, as his name appeared in a 'List of Signers for Official Documents Submitted to the Shogunate' ('Bakufu Teishutsu Josho Shomeisha Ichiran' in Japanese) which was dated July 10, 1863. 
<br/>Shimenoshin participated in the Coup of August 18 (which occurred on September 30, 1863.)<br/>
However, judging from the fact that Shimenoshin's name was not included in a record of the Ikedaya Incident taking place on July 8, 1864, he supposedly escaped before then. </p>
