<h1>MINAMOTO no Yoshisuke (源義資)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Yoshisuke (unknown to 1180) was a warrior in the end of the Heian period. Yoshisuke was a member of the Ishikawa clan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> line (Minamoto clan). Yoshisuke was called Nijo Yoshisuke because he was an assistant nijoin judge. Yoshisuke's offspring founded the Manriki clan. A child of Yoshisuke's was MINAMONO no Ariyoshi and some people say that Ariyoshi was a child of Nobuyoshi TAKEDA. MINAMOTO no Nobumori was a grandson of Yoshisuke's and gave the family name of Manriki to himself. </p>
