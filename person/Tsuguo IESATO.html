<h1>IESATO Tsuguo (家里次郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsuguo IESATO (1840 - June 10, 1863) was a member of Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warrior group). </p>
<p>He was born in present Matsuzaka City (of former Ise Province) as the second son of Seiemon KOBAYASHI. He joined the Roshigumi in February 1863. </p>
<p>After he went up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he remained there with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kamo SERIZAWA.html">Kamo SERIZAWA</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshio TONOUCHI.html">Yoshio TONOUCHI</a>. Afterwards, Tonouchi was assassinated and Yuzan NEGISHI withdrew the group in the internal leadership struggle, and Iesato who left in isolation ran away from the group, but he was forced to commit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> (ritual suicide by disembowelment) by Serizawa when he was hiding in Osaka. </p>
<p>On July 3, 1863, only one month later from the death of Tsuguo IESATO, Shoto IESATO, his older brother and Confucian scholar, was also assassinated by someone in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
