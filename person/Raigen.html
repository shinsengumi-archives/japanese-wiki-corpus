<h1>Raigen (頼源)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Raigen (year of birth unknown - March 26, 1183) was an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ebusshi.html">ebusshi</a> (artist who draws Buddhist paintings and colors Buddhist statues) in the late Heian period. His father was Raisuke. </p>
<p>At the wish of FUJUWARA no Tadamich, he drew Yoe Kannon in 1142. Thanks to his father's distinguished service, he was appointed to Hokkyo (the third highest rank of artists for Buddhist sculpture) in kansho (awarding prize or position to people who rendered distinguished service) which took place at the occasion of a memorial service for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ensho-ji Temple.html">Ensho-ji Temple</a> in 1149, and later on, he was promoted to Hogen (the second highest rank of artists for Buddhist sculpture). Although it is known that he drew many paintings such as Ryokai mandara and Amida Nyorai-zo (the statue of Amida Tathagata), none of his works exist today. </p>
