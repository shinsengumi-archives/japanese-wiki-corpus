<h1>TAKATSUKASA Tadafuyu (鷹司忠冬)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadafuyu TAKATSUKASA (1509 - May 21, 1546) was a Kuge (court noble) who lived during the Sengoku period (period of warring states). His official court rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) and he held the position of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor). His father was Kanesuke TAKATSUKASA. His mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinharu OGIMACHISANJO.html">Kinharu OGIMACHISANJO</a>. </p>
<p>The Takatsukasa family temporarily ceased to exist due to Tadafuyu not having an heir, but the son of Haruyoshi NIJO, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobufusa TAKATSUKASA.html">Nobufusa TAKATSUKASA</a>, revived the family in the Shokuho period. </p>
