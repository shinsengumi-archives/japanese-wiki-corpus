<h1>Jinseigata (仁政方)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jinseigata was one of the institutions established during the early Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). It is presumed to have been an institution that addressed a direct appeal to a senior official without going through the normal formalities as a relief measure against a judicial decision made by Hikitsukeshu (Coadjustor of the High Court). It was composed of tonin (the director) and several bugyonin (magistrates). </p>
<p>It was as early as 1341 when it first appeared in historical records as a legal institution. During the term from 1373 to 1375, the proceedings which appealed not to Hikitsukeshu, but to Jinseigata for a ruling had been recorded. It is thought that it lasted for at least forty years or more at the early stage of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. However, it seems to have been abolished after the middle of the Muromachi period because it cannot be found in the organizational chart of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> thereafter. </p>
