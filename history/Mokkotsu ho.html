<p>Mokkotsu ho is one of the techniques in Oriental painting. It is a drawing technique to express, from the beginning, the shape and color on the canvas without drawing contours. It is one of the two major drawing techniques along with roroku ho (painting technique with contours) in Oriental painting. </p>
<p>It is mainly used in kachoga (painting of flowers and birds), and the technique is said to be the technique of Joshitai belonging to the lineage of Joki and Josushi. </p>
