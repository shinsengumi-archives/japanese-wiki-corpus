<h1>Gojo Rakuen (五条楽園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gojo Rakuen is an old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yukaku (red-light district).html">yukaku</a> (a red-light district) site located in the south-east area of Kawaramachi-dori and Gojo-dori Streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>.

<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Gojo Rakuen had establishments called ochaya (literally "teahouse" which refers to places where geisha entertain their guests) that have a structure similar to a Japanese inn. Unlike machiai-jaya (tea houses, establishments that rented rooms in which visitors and geisha could amuse themselves) in Hanamachi (geisha districts in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), they offered adult entertainment. </p>
<p>Gojo Rakuen originated as two separate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yukaku (red-light district).html">yukaku</a> called Gojo-hashishita and Nanajo-shinchi located next to each other, but the two merged during the Taisho period and became Gojo Rakuen. </p>
