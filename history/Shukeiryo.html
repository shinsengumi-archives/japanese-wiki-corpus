<h1>Shukeiryo (主計寮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shukeiryo is an organization which belonged to Minbusho (civil and administrative ministry) under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). The name has other pronunciations in Japanese like Kazue no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The job of Shukeiryo was to figure out and audit the tax revenues (especially those from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/So-Yo-Cho.html">So-Yo-Cho</a> tax system). In concrete terms, it was to calculate the volume of tax revenues and audit whether or not it reached the defined volume. Therefore the skill of mathematics (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sando.html">Sando</a>) was required, by which it continued as a principal job after the collapse of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. One of the staff called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sakan (Kokushi).html">Sakan</a> of Shukeiryo became a ministry official called Koto of Minbusho and concentrated on the clerical work. The name, Shukeiryo has remained as Shukeikyoku (Budget Bureau) and Shukeikan (a budget officer) of Ministry of Finance (Japan) now. <h3>Officials</h3>
