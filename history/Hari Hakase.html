<h1>Hari Hakase (針博士)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hari hakase (Doctor of acupuncture) is a member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenyakuryo.html">Tenyakuryo</a> (medical and pharmaceutical department) of the Imperial Household Ministry. It is equivalent to Jushichiinoge (Junior Seventh Rank, Lower Grade). The fixed number of seats was one. Hari hakase educated the students of acupuncture and supervised acupuncturists. </p>
<p>After the students of acupuncture (limited to 30 people) finished a two year basic course and seven years of professional training (skill practice and technical book reading) under a Hari hakase, they took the final and commissioning exam held by their Hari Hakase and those who passed it started acupuncture treatment as acupuncturists. Hari hakase was selected from top performers among graduates. </p>
