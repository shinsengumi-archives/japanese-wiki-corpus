<h1>So (租)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>So as well as Zei are the goods and services that the government collect to ensure public finance for the nation. According to Setsumon-kaiji (Shuowen Jiezi) (Explaining Simple and Analyzing Compound Characters), So is defined as "Tax levied on rice crops," which was originally Denso, and was collected nominally for ritual expenses. </p>
<p>So is what is newly collected (Flow), and saved So (Stock) is Zei. Refer to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sozei.html">Sozei</a>. </p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code), Denso was collected as So. Under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/So-Yo-Cho.html">So-Yo-Cho</a> (the tax system), only So had the aspect of land tax. </p>
