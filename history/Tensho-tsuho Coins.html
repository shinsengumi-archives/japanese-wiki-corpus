<h1>Tensho-tsuho Coins (天正通宝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tensho-tsuho are coins that were issued during the Azuchimomoyama period. This is the first coin that was minted in Japan since Kocho Junisen coins. It was first cast in 1587. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Tensho-tsuho was issued by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. They were used mainly as rewards to honor military officers, and there were gold coins and silver coins. According to the "Sankazui," bronze coins were cast for use as a currency but details are not known. Since the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toyotomi clan.html">Toyotomi clan</a> was extinguished at the Battle of Osaka, the coins were in circulation for only a short time. Other coins that Hideyoshi issued include Tensho Oban (1588) and Bunroku-suho (1592). </p>
<p>These coins minted by Hideyoshi were used solely as rewards or to cover military expenses, and it was only in the Edo period, with the issuance of the Kan-ei-tsuho that minting of coins for the purpose of circulation was resumed. 
<br/>(Keichotsuho was minted by the Tokugawa clan in 1606 but the coins were never adequately circulated.)<br/>
