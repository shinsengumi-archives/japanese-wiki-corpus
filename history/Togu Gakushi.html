<h1>Togu Gakushi (東宮学士)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Togu gakushi were one of the educational officers who served the Crown Prince (Togu) under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). </p>
<p>They were tutors as a sort of fellow students of the Crown Prince and taught Confucianism to him. An officer similar to them was a fumihakase (an official who taught Imperial prince classic Confucian writings), a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> (household superintendent) of the Imperial prince. The regular number for Togu gakushi was two and their official court ranks were equivalent to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). Confucian scholars were often appointed to these posts and they sometimes worked as close advisers after the Crown Prince ascended to the throne. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Togubo (Crown Princes Quarters).html">Togubo</a> (Crown Prince's quarters) was sometimes also called Togu-shiki (the board of the Crown Prince's affairs) in conjunction with Togunofu (an official in charge of education of the Crown Prince) from the mid Heian period. They were also called Kotaishigakushi. </p>
