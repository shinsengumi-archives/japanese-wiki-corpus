<h1>Goteni (御典医)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Goteni (御典医) were doctors who belonged to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenyakuryo.html">Tenyakuryo</a> (the Bureau of Medicine) in the Imperial Court, and were simply called teni. In extension, in the Edo period the doctors who were employed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lord) were also called by this name. In this case, it is sometimes described as 御殿医 (goteni). </p>
<p>Goteni in the meaning of doctors of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenyakuryo.html">Tenyakuryo</a> indicates, except <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tenyaku (government post).html">Tenyaku</a> no kami (the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenyakuryo.html">tenyakuryo</a>) which was an honorary position, the doctors who were indeed engaged in treatment of emperors. In the early modern times, in most cases, when a private doctor was employed by the Court, he was given an official court rank at the same time and became jigenin (a lower rank of ancient Japanese nobility). </p>
<p>On the other hand, in the case of goteni of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, the doctors who got close with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> or hanshu (the lord of domain) to treat them were given a position of quasi-samurai. </p>
