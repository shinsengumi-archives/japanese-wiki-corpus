<h1>Mikinotsukasa (branch office of ministry) (造酒司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mikinotsukasa (also called Sakenotsukasa) was a branch office of Kunaisho, erected under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> legal code system. </p>
<p>Its main duty was supervising brewing of sake, amasake, and vinegar. In Mikinotsukasa, three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats ranks).html">Shitokan</a> officials, i.e., Kami, Jo, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sakan (Kokushi).html">Sakan</a> were placed; on the other hand, an official corresponding to Suke was not prepared. Also, Sakabe and Tsukaibe were placed. Sakadono for brewing sake was built in Mikinotsukasa, where officials such as Betto and Ben were placed. </p>
