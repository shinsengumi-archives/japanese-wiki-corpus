<h1>Sotsuzoku (low-ranking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) (卒族)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sotsuzoku was a name of social status in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. Low-ranking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> called differently as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">Doshin</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> (a foot soldier) in each domain, who did not have the status of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, were examples. In 1870, the designation started; however, it was abolished two years later. </p>
<p>In the abolition of Sotsuzoku, the hereditary Sotsuzoku was incorporated into Shizoku (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class), and the one-off generation of Sotsuzoku into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heimin (commoners).html">Heimin</a> (commoner). </p>
