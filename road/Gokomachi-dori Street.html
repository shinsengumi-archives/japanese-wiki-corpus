<h1>Gokomachi-dori Street (御幸町通)</h1>
<p>Gokomachi-dori Street is one of the streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> that run in the north-south direction. 
<br/>It is one block west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teramachi-dori Street.html">Teramachi-dori Street</a> and stretches from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> to the north and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> to the south. <br/>
It did not exist when the city was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> but was newly build by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMO under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> no Jiwari land allotment plan. <br/>
The origin of the street name remains unclear; one theory is that the name derives from Hideyoshi having traveled the street when paying a visit to the Imperial Court from Osaka (or Fushimi). <br/>
</p>
<p>The street between Sanjo-dori and Shijo-dori streets has many cultural facilities, such as Art Complex 1928 in Sanjo Gokomachi, and shops catering to young people. </p>
